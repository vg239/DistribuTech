## Email Notification System

DistribuTech includes a comprehensive email notification system that alerts users about:

1. **Order Updates**: Notifications when orders are created, processed, shipped, etc.
2. **Low Stock Alerts**: Warnings when inventory falls below defined thresholds
3. **Test Emails**: For verifying system configuration

### Configuration

Email settings can be configured in the backend `settings.py` file. The system supports:

- SMTP email backends for production
- Console backend for development (prints emails to console)
- File-based backend for testing (saves emails to a directory)
- Mailtrap integration for testing real emails without sending to real recipients

See `distributech_backend/EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### Testing Email Functionality

Use the provided management commands to test email functionality:

```bash
# Send a test email
python manage.py send_test_email recipient@example.com

# Check stock levels and send alerts
python manage.py check_stock_levels

# Send notification for a specific order
python manage.py send_order_notification 123
```
